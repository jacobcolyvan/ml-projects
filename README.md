# ML Projects
This is a collection of small projects that I've started working on to teachmyself machine learning and data science foundations.

The projects included at this point use a tech stack that includes:
* Python
* NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
* Scitkit-learn

So far the only project in this rep is:
* A <i>Poker-Hand Classification</i> notebook, that explores building a model that classifies a poker hand (pair, flush, etc.) based on the five cards it is given.
