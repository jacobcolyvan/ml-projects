# ML Projects
This is a collection of small projects that I've started working on to learn machine learning and data science foundations. Jupyter notebooks for each can be found in the project folder.

The projects included at this point use a tech stack that includes:
* Python
* NumPy / Pandas / Matplotlib
* ScitKit-learn
* Jupyter Notebook


Ther projects in this rep are: </br>
* A <i>Poker-Hand Classification</i> notebook, that explores building a model that classifies a poker hand (pair, flush, etc.) based on the five cards it is given.
* An <i>Ethereum Price Regression</i> notebook, that explores predicting the daily closing price of one ether given the daily trading indicators of that day.

### Setup
The folder employs a MinoConda/Conda env, which once set up you can replicate by running `conda env create --file environment.yml --name env_from_file`.

MiniConda can be set up by following the following instructions: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html.

Interesting stuff, interesting times! <br/>
Happy coding.
